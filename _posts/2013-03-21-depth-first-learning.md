As I continue to learn new programming languages, frameworks and concepts its very easy to just stay in your comfort zone and only get a basic level of understanding about a multitude of subjects.

While that might be okay for a short period of time just to find out what you are interested in there is going to be a time when you need to pick one thing and dive as deep into it as possible.

It's great that I know Objective-C, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Wordpress, Sinatra, Rails, etc. but beyond making a simple todo list application with a tiny database and zero users how much to you really know about these subjects beyond an elementary level?

Part of the reason why I started to build Networkcraft was because I'm forcing myself to graduate from elementary school and on a really deep level understand a single topic: Building great web applications written in Ruby on Rails that support thousands of users.

I feel like I should have started this years ago. And I guess I have been putting off truly learning a single topic because It's far easier to just jump to the next area of interest and stay on your training wheels, then it is it dive into the unknown and do something entirely on your own and make something that doesn't exist yet.
