# Blake Erickson

I’m a software developer and builder. I’ve been in tech for 20+ years and writing code for most of that time, mostly with Ruby/Rails and JavaScript, turning messy ideas into small, well-designed products.

Previously, I spent over eight years at Discourse as a software engineer, working across the core app and plugin ecosystem — building features, shaping APIs, and building internal tools to help my team be more productive.

I care a lot about developer experience: clear APIs, good docs, and small feedback loops. I’m happiest when I’m owning a product end-to-end — from sketching out an idea, to designing the data model, to polishing the UI, to writing the README so future travelers know what they’re getting into.

Outside of work, I’m a husband, parent, snowboarder, and car nerd. If I’m not at a keyboard, I’m probably tuning a Subaru, riding a mountain bike, or in the mountains somewhere in Idaho.

I’m currently building [Recourss](https://app.recourss.com), a Discourse-powered RSS reader. You can see more of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/oblakeerickson) or follow me on [X](https://x.com/oblakeerickson). If you’d like to get in touch, email me at blake [at] blake [dot] app.
