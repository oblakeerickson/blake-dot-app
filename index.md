I’m a software developer and builder. I've been programming and diving deep into the depths of computers since I was a teenager and 20+ years later I still can't get enough. I'm most experienced building (and scaling!) web apps with Ruby/Rails and JavaScript, but I'm quickly falling in love with Rust and TypeScript as my tools of choice.

Previously, I spent just shy of 9 years at Discourse as a Senior Software Engineer. I was an early employee (#11) and worked in many different capacities from devops like roles, doing feature development in Rails and Emberjs, to working closely with enterprise customers and users to build an amazing product they love. My most recent project was [adding background video encoding support via aws mediaconvert](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/33092).

I thrive on solving customer problems as well as improving the tools we use every day. My favorite moments come from delivering unanticipated delight when shipping ideas that merge naturally from deep product knowledge and a strong sense of what users are really after.

Outside of work, I’m a husband, parent, snowboarder, and car nerd. If I’m not at a keyboard, I’m probably tinkering on a Subaru in my garage, or escaping up in the mountains to snowboard somewhere in Idaho.

Last month I wrote about how [Discourse uses Discourse](https://blog.discourse.org/2025/11/how-discourse-uses-discourse/) on the Discourse blog. 

On my own [blog](/blog/) I've written:

- [Prolonged Effort, Hard Work, Coupled with Postive Focus, Thinking About the Thing](/blog/prolonged-effort/)
- [Bug Crushing Adventure](/blog/bug-crushing-adventure/)
- [The Best Free Email Service for Hobby Projects](/blog/smtp2go/)
- [Nobody will Train You but You](/blog/nobody-will-train-you-but-you/)
- [Work on Tooling](/blog/work-on-tooling/)
- [Contributing To Discourse](/blog/contributing-to-discourse/)

Some hobby projects I’m currently building are [Recourss](https://app.recourss.com) (an RSS reader app), [ofcourse.chat](https://app.ofcourse.chat) (hosted Discourse [*just*-chat](https://github.com/oblakeerickson/discourse-just-chat) instances), and [my.ntbk.co](https://my.ntbk.co) (Take detailed notes, keep track of tasks, create daily checklists, and accomplish more through organized thought!). See what else I'm hacking on by taking a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/oblakeerickson) profile or follow me on [X](https://x.com/oblakeerickson). You can also see what I'm working on [today](https://plan.blake.app/20251212.html). If you’d like to get in touch, email me at blake [at] blake [dot] app.

I'm currently on the lookout for a one-of-a-kind founder led company that I can apply my decades of software engineering obsession into. If that's you and you are hiring, hit me up!
