# Blake Erickson

I’m a software developer and builder. I've been programming and diving deep into the depths of computers since I was a teenager and 20+ years later I still can't get enough. I'm most experienced in Ruby/Rails and JavaScript, but I'm quickly falling in love with Rust and TypeScript as the tools of choice.

Previously, I spent just shy of 9 years at Discourse as a Senior Software Engineer. I was an early employee (#11) and worked in many different capacities from devops like roles, doing feature development in Rails and Emberjs, to working closely with enterprise customers and users to build an amazing product they love. My most recent project was [adding background video encoding support via aws mediaconvert](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/33092).

I love solving problems for customers as well as writing tools and improving the software we use as a team to be more productive. I also love offering some unanticipated delight shipping a new features and ideas that just come to me through my deep knowledge of the products I work on and knowing what users are really after.

Outside of work, I’m a husband, parent, snowboarder, and car nerd. If I’m not at a keyboard, I’m probably tuning a Subaru, riding a mountain bike, or in the mountains somewhere in Idaho.

I recently wrote this post on the Discourse blog: https://blog.discourse.org/2025/11/how-discourse-uses-discourse/

Some hobby projects I’m currently building are [Recourss](https://app.recourss.com) (an RSS reader app) and [ofcourse.chat](https://app.ofcourse.chat) (hosted Discourse *just*-chat instances). See what else I'm hacking on by taking a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/oblakeerickson) profile or follow me on [X](https://x.com/oblakeerickson). If you’d like to get in touch, email me at blake [at] blake [dot] app.

I'm currently on the lookout for a one-of-kind founder led company that I can apply my decades of software engineering obsession into. If that's you and you are hiring, hit me up!
